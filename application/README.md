# Meet In The Middle

An application to find places to meet friends and family when you're all coming from different directions.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Access the API

The easiest way to access the API is to use Postman or another client to send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/hello-world`.
